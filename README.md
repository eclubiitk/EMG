# EMG

Wearable technology is the future of electronics gadgets. As interesting as it seems, it has myriad applications. This project aims at creating one such prototype, a hand gesture recognition system, using electromyography.
Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by the skeletal muscles. The basics of EMG are used to design a circuit that takes the differential signals from two electrodes placed on the same muscle at different locations as input, with one electrode as bone reference. 
The circuit pre-amplifies the input signal, filters the resultant signal for noise, rectifies it, and finally amplifies it. This output signal is then fed to a machine learning algorithm, which associates different signals with different data, and hence different gestures, and this can be utilized further to integrate with objects, that can be controlled using the gesture recognition system.
